closure:

-1 header
+0 function-entry-point
+1 function
+2 environment


fref:

-1 header
+0 name
+1 function
+2 function-entry-point

FUNCTION calling convention:

function in rbx
call via entry-point


FREF calling convention:
fref in r13
call via entry-point


UNWIND-PROTECT cleanup fn calling convention:
function in r13
environment in rbx
call via entry point


When an fref is set to a closure (or funcallable-instance?), the entry-point
is set to a trampoline function:

;; Load the real function.
mov :rbx (:object :r13 :slot function)
;; Invoke the real function via the FUNCTION calling convention.
;; This will work even if the fref was altered.
jmp (:object :rbx :slot closure-entry-point)


The fref's function value and entry-point value will be set to appropriate
values from the undefined-function thunk when the fref is made funbound.
This allows the closure trampoline to avoid explicitly testing for funboundness.
