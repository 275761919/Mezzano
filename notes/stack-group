The stack group object is the funadmental representation of machine state.
It contains the state of all GPRs, x87 and SSE registers, along with references
to the control stack, lisp stack and special stack. Per-thread symbol bindings
are stored directly in the stack group, currently limited to a fixed number of symbols.
